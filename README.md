# DataCamp

Welcome to my DataCamp repository! This repository contains a series of Jupyter notebooks that document my progress and achievements in various data science courses offered by DataCamp. The notebooks primarily focus on exploratory data analysis and Python-based projects. 

Please note that the content in this repository is intended for personal demonstration of my skills and learning journey. It is not intended for use in academic dishonesty or as a substitute for doing your own coursework.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **/notebooks**: This directory contains all the Jupyter notebooks, each corresponding to different modules or projects completed on DataCamp.
- **/data**: Sample datasets used in the notebooks for analysis and visualization.
- **/scripts**: Contains Python scripts that supplement the Jupyter notebooks, if applicable.
- **/images**: Any images or graphics used in the notebooks for explanation or visualization purposes.

## Setup and Installation

To get started with these notebooks, you'll need to set up a Python environment and install some dependencies. Here's how you can do it:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/DataCamp.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the cloned repository:
   ```bash
   cd DataCamp
   ```

3. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. To open and run the notebooks, start Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook interface in your browser, where you can open and run the notebooks.

## Usage

To use the notebooks, simply navigate to the `/notebooks` directory after launching Jupyter Notebook. Here you can open any notebook you wish to view or edit.

Example:
- Open `Introduction_to_Python.ipynb` to start with the basics of Python used in the DataCamp courses.

Each notebook is self-contained and includes both the necessary code and datasets needed for execution.

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome, especially from fellow DataCamp students who wish to collaborate on projects or enhance the existing notebooks.

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Make your changes.
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`).
5. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`).
