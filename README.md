# DataCamp

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks that I have used to document my progress through various data science coursework on DataCamp. Each notebook is a testament to the skills and knowledge I've acquired, showcasing my ability to perform exploratory data analysis and complete Python-based projects. Please note that these materials are intended for personal use and demonstration only. Any misuse for academic dishonesty is strictly prohibited.

## Topics

- Python
- DataCamp
- Python3

## Setup and Installation

To run these notebooks, you will need to have Python installed, preferably Python 3.6 or later. You can download Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

You will also need to install Jupyter Notebook. The easiest way to do this is by installing the Anaconda distribution which includes Python, Jupyter Notebook, and other commonly used packages for scientific computing and data science. You can download Anaconda from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).

Once you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed, navigate to the directory containing the notebooks and run the command `jupyter notebook` to start the Jupyter Notebook App. The app will open in your default web browser.

## Usage Examples

The Jupyter notebooks in this repository are fully executable and can be run to reproduce the results that I have obtained. To do this, open the notebook you wish to run in the Jupyter Notebook App, select the cell you wish to run, and then click the 'run' button. Alternatively, you can run a cell by pressing `Shift + Enter`.
